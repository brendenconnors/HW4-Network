Visualization of data that is one-to-many. Visualizing the passing sequences started by Jimmy Butler in game 5 of the NBA finals. All data was recorded myself.

The jupyter notebook contains two ways to visualize data. The last cell will create a Dash rendering that includes hypothesis and other text explanations. However, there is an issue with Dash and Plotly's Sankey that does not allow the custom data on hover to be displayed as I wanted. This custom data is shown in the sankey contained in fig2.
